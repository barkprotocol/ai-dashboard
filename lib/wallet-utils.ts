//  The provided updates do not give specific code to replace.  The error message "Expected an expression but instead found '...'." indicates a syntax error likely caused by an improperly escaped ellipsis (...) within a string or JSX attribute.  Without the original code containing the ellipsis, I cannot provide a corrected version.  To fix this, the ellipsis needs to be escaped correctly depending on its context.  For example:

// If within a string:
// const myString = "This string contains an ellipsis: \\...";

// If within a JSX attribute:
// <MyComponent myProp={`This prop contains an ellipsis: ...`} />  would become
// <MyComponent myProp={"This prop contains an ellipsis: ..."} /> or handle it differently depending on the framework.

// Please provide the line of code containing the ellipsis for a proper fix.
